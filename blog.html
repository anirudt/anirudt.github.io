   <p> You could be aware of the <i>time</i> command, which prints the time taken for execution of the command after it is completed. A nice timer could be made by using the following command: <br>
   <code>
     >> time cat
   </code>
   <br> After this, you could press a Ctrl+C to stop the timer!<br>

      The absence of sufficient notifications for decreasing battery percentage gave the motivation for me, especially in cases of DWM where there is no explicit/default battery percentage being indicated. Using a voice system like <i> espeak</i>, we achieve good results, as can be seen in the following <a href = "https://github.com/anirudt/battery-monitor/">Github repository.</a>

    <h3>Fun fact: How to go to incognito terminal mode?</h3>
    <h4>Date: 15th September, 2015</h4>
    <p>
      To go to incognito mode, i.e. to prevent .bash_history from recording your command, all you need to do is to put a space just before your command. It is useful for cases when you are trying to run commands on some other PC or, you're using confidential information in the command itself. Thus, Unix again presents a hacky way around things.

    <h3>RegEx with Perl</h3>
    <h4>Date: 29th March, 2015</h4>
    <p> This particular experience was very enriching personally for me. Having coded the same in C, I wanted to verify my answers in Perl. Basically, it was a protein database, from which we had to extract the x,y,z coordinates of some of the atoms, and find the centroids. I decided to use reg-ex for this purpose, and to my surprise and happiness, it did work well! This is the link to the code, and you can see the elegance of perl in this.

    <h3> Beginning with Perl</h3>
    <h4>Date: 25th March, 2015 </h4>
    <p> It's been almost a month since I've posted something, as I was smewhat busy into academics and my Image Restoration project. As part of a series of pet projects, I decided to kick start with perl. Perl is a powerful language having both OOP and Procedural tendencies. Installed perl on Cygwin on my Windows 8.1 system and got started with an exquisite set of man pages. This should be pretty self explanatory. <br>
    <code>>> perldoc perl</code>
    <br>
    Here's a Hello World program with Perl.
    <code><br>
      use warnings;<br>
      use strict;<br>

      my $name = "Anirud";<br>
      print $name;<br>

    <h3>Update to the Android-Java-JNI Project</h3>
    <h4>Date: 27th February, 2015</h4>
    <p> After implementing some Image Processing in the backend in Java, the slowness of the computation forced me to fall onto C/C++ for backend work, using OpenCV. Thus, I had to use JNI interface which extends a native outlook to Java which helps in interchange of data between Java and C/C++. For this, I found two useful links, which talk about Array interchange between Java and C++, which could be quite difficult, considering the difference in the data structures in which both of them store their so called "arrays". These resources could be found <a href="https://code.google.com/p/awesomeguy/wiki/JNITutorial#Passing_Arrays">here</a> and an error rectification source <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/android-ndk/6abInJBSMEI">here</a>. Thus, effectively, the array can be passed from Java to the native portion for processing, and the processed array can also be exchanged back without much effort. This is a good breakthrough in terms of data handling.

    <h3>Links for Word Lattice Implementation</h3>
    <h4>Date: 23rd February, 2014</h4>
    <p>I am currently working with word lattices in Grammatical Error Correction [GEC], using OpenFST, where I need an implementation of a word lattice in Python. Sharing two links I found useful, <a href="http://www.cdec-decoder.org/concepts/lattices.html">here</a> and <a href="http://www.statmt.org/moses/?n=Moses.WordLattices">here.</a> Both use some form of PLF, as in Python Lattice Format. Have to look into it a little more deeply.

    <br>
    Edit: I ended up using the following data structure: A dictionary where each key is the initial state, and the value is the list of lists, where each sub-list consisted of the output state, and the edge materials [the string and the associated weight]. This was a little heavy, but it encoded all the information nevertheless. Later, I found the Networkx library hosted on GitHub which could be an easier way to implement and use Graph Algorithms.
    <br>
    An article should follow about use of OpenFST, pointers to good useful documentation.

      <h3>IP with Android</h3>
      <h4>22nd February, 2015</h4>
      <p> This was my first tryst with Android, and has been quite a painful and a rigorous one, not to mention useful. It involved using the phone camera taking in input, and the application trying to process the images real time. I tried a lot of things to make it work at every step, and here is my last combination, which made it work.
      <br> 
      <ul>
      <li>Eclipse, coupled with CDT[C/C++ Development Tools]</li>
      <li>Cygwin[primarily for C/C++ compilation]</li>
      <li>JNI interface</li>
      <li>NDK & SDK Environment</li>
    </ul>
      I propose to complete the IP part using OpenCV, and compile the C/C++ file and load it into the Android portion using the native libraries. More on this, once I complete it. <a href="http://permadi.com/blog/2011/09/setting-up-android-jni-projects-in-windows-eclipse-and-sequoyah/">Here</a>'s a walkthrough I followed properly. </p>

  <h3>GDB Exploits</h3>
  <h4>Date: 19th October, 2014</h4>
  <p>The following key exploits can be utilized in the GDB Debugger.
<ul>
    <li>To enter, place <code>gdb exe_file_name</code> to enter into the GDB debugger.</li>
    <li>To place break points, use<code> break function_name</code>, else use <code>break *addressline</code> to break onto that particular line.</li>
    <li>To compute the dissasembly of a function, say main, type <code>disas main</code> at the prompt.</li>
    <li>To run the program with some argc, argv arguments, type <code>run [arguments]</code>.</li>
    <li>To get the hex memory dump, type <code>x/32xw $esp</code> to show first 32 lines of the memory dump. This is similar to <code>xxd</code>. Also, the<code> $esp</code> shows the stack pointer. The earlier ‘x’ stands for the examine function. And the succeeding ‘x’ stands for showing hex patterns.</li>
    <li>Type ‘c’ for continue and ‘s’ for stepping one step at a time.</li>
    <li>To get information about the values stored in the various registers, type <code>info registers</code>, or just<code> i r</code>.</li>
    <li>To backtrace the function calls, just put a bt once at a breakpoint/amidst the running of the program call.</li>

  <h3>Vim Ideology</h3>
  <h4>Date: 19th October, 2014</h4>
  <p>There are basically 3 modes functioning within Vim. One, a middle mode used for aligning the basic format of the entire document, Two, the main mode for editing and adding stuff, and Three, a mode for exiting, saving, etc.
    <ul>
    <li>From 1 to 2: Press i.</li>
    <li>From 1 to 3: Press ‘:’ and type commands.</li>
    <li>From 2 to 1: Press escape once, or as many times.</li>
    <li>Press ‘>>’ for aligning. Keep a number ‘n >>’ for shifting the next n lines of code by the same.</li>
    <li>‘Ctrl+A’ for going to the last letter of the line in Middle Mode[1].</li>
    <li>‘dd’ for deleting the present line.</li>
    <li>‘.’ for doing what you just did again.</li>
    <li>h,j,k,l are arrow keys in the middle mode.</li>

  <h3>Smash the stack</h3>
  <h4>Date: 22nd September, 2014</h4>
  <p>One of the main concepts involved in Capture The Flag stage, named Cusco, typically revolved around smashing the stack. The earlier stages involved finding clues about the password within the live memory. This one prevented any such processes, and allowed a longer password than the earlier one. Let us talk about what the term exactly means, so that we can effectively use it for future purposes.<br> What does it mean? <br>Smashing the stack, involves storing input into a stack, which will overflow the existing number of bytes in the stack. This thus, will creep into the memory locations of the neighboring registers, executing which, we can manipulate the program counter. Another hack procedure, could be to search for a return command, as the program counter will point to where the stack pointer is, after execution.

The <b>strcpy</b> function also has bugs, which can be exploited.

    <h3>Quine McClusky Implementation</h3>
    <h4>Date: 21st September, 2014</h4>
    <p>As part of my Digital Electronics Course, I implemented an implementation of the renowned Quine McClusky Algorithm for multivariable function minimization. So, here are the learnings that I could derive from it:
      <br>
    <b>Why Python</b>
      <br>
    I was personally biased towards Python for this particular problem statement, as I realised, that a number of arrays, and lists of different kinds of data would be required, for indexing and for storage purposes. Python offers a plethora of options, and also some built-in functions implementing which in C/Java could take various lines of code.

   <h3>Stack pointer and memory storage conventions</h3>
   <h4>Date: 20th September, 2014</h4> 
   <p>A noteworthy point of discussion is the difference in conventions of the stack pointer direction. Following are the points to note:
    <ul>
    <li>The stack pointer moves about, throughout the stack, and is the head of the stack. Any pushing/popping happens where it points to.</li>
    <li>Memory allocation is from bottom(least) to top(most).</li>
    <li>When the caller function meets the calling statement of another function, the stack pointer goes a few required bytes down, and begins execution of the statements. Then, it will come back and follow all steps again.</li>
    <li>The register values stored inside the functions also depend on the lexical scope that they’re based at. Hence, if any value needs to be stored, decrement/increment the sp accordingly and store the values there, to be popped at the time of reference.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Jumping into CTFs</h3>
    <h4>Date: 18th September, 2014</h4>
    <p>My first play and learn session with CTF was really exhilarating. This is a wonderful way to learn Assembly Language, and to gain a good understanding of what ‘Capture the Flag’ actually is. Following is a synopsis of the tutorial concerned with it, which forms the primary building block of what comes after this.<br>

     <b>Some Assembly commands were: </b> 
    <ul>
      <li><code>tst </code>– testing whether a number is non zero or not</li>
      <li><code>mov</code> – moving the first operand into the second operand [more appropriately, the value]</li>
      <li><code>add</code> – storing the sum of the two operands into the second one [will take only the 4 bits and ignore any overflow bits]</li>
      <li><code>inc/dec </code>– inc(dec)rementing the value of the register</li>
      <li><code>incd/decd</code> – inc(dec)rementing the value of the register by 2 bytes</li>
      <li><code>jnz</code> – jumping if the register dealt with in the previous line of code is not zero</li>
      <li><code>jeq/jz</code> – jumping if the register dealt with in the previous line of code is zero, or equal( essentially, both mean the same, as the cmp function hands over a ‘zero flag’ once the two numbers are equal.)</li>
      <li><code>cmp </code>– compares two values and stores the result in a status flag</li>
      <li><code>ret</code> – returns the control to the caller function
      <li><code>swpb</code> – swaps the bits [in a nibble]</li>
      <li><code>bis</code> - Binary subtracts and stores the lesser significant 4 bits/ Also called Bit set, or the ‘OR’ operation.</li>
      <li><code>sxt</code> – Extends the word to binary form, to enable mathematical operations on the register, like addition, multiplication, etc.    </li>
    </ul>  
    <br>
    <b>Some basic conventions are:</b>
      <ul>
        <li>#x – refers to a constant value to be added, operated or compare to.</li>
        <li>@R – works like the *ptr form, which accesses the value stored within a register pointed to by R. </li>
      </ul>
      <br>
      <b>Basic Learnings and things to carry forward
      </b>
      <ul>

      <li>sr – this is the Status Register, hovering the mouse over it would indicate  c-> carry flag is set, else it means that the zero flag is not set yet</li>
      <li>The Disassembly contains all the code available within the kernel for manipulation and reading</li>
      <li>The Memory Area will contain the values stored inside the different registers in their specific addresses</li>
      <li>The Instruction Area exactly contains which instruction is going to be executed. This can be accomplished properly with step(s), break(b) etc.</li>
      <li>The console can be reached for help by using the ‘help’ command</li>
      <li>In the tutorial, r12 – stores the number of letters the entered password contains</li>
      <li>All details are stored in hex, base 16</li>
      </ul>
      <br><b> Key Idea </b>
      Find the code line which needs to be reached, and try to backtrack your events from there for better understanding of what needs to be achieved. Analyse the <check-password> function properly.
