  <h3>Vim Ideology</h3>
  <h4>Date: 19th October, 2014</h4>
  <p>There are basically 3 modes functioning within Vim. One, a middle mode used for aligning the basic format of the entire document, Two, the main mode for editing and adding stuff, and Three, a mode for exiting, saving, etc.
    <ul>
    <li>From 1 to 2: Press i.</li>
    <li>From 1 to 3: Press ‘:’ and type commands.</li>
    <li>From 2 to 1: Press escape once, or as many times.</li>
    <li>Press ‘>>’ for aligning. Keep a number ‘n >>’ for shifting the next n lines of code by the same.</li>
    <li>‘Ctrl+A’ for going to the last letter of the line in Middle Mode[1].</li>
    <li>‘dd’ for deleting the present line.</li>
    <li>‘.’ for doing what you just did again.</li>
    <li>h,j,k,l are arrow keys in the middle mode.</li>
 </ul>

    <h3>List of Unix Commands used in Bandit/CTFs</h3>
    <h4>Date: 18th October, 2014</h4>
    <p>A list of Linux tools used for Bandit. Some specific usages are also provided.
    <ul>
      <li>
    <code>du</code> - used for estimating file space usage by a file</li>
    <li><code>file ./* </code>– used for giving the file types of all the files present in the present working directory</li>
    <li><code>ls, cd, cat, find </code>- pretty obvious/frequent to use</li>
    <li>Spaces in the file-name can be overridden by use of a backslash.</li>
    <li><code>grep</code> – match lines corresponding to a particular pattern. Very useful command, with lots of flags enabled as well.</li>
    <li><code>base64</code> – base64 encode/decode data. Use the -d flag for decoding.</li>
    <li><code>sort</code> – sorts lines of text files</li>
    <li><code>uniq </code>– output/omit repeated files. Can be modelled well using a number of flags. See our Frequency Analysis post for the same.</li>
    <li><code>tr </code>– translate characters. Helps to map a string/or encode it into a particular cipher. Used for cryptographical purposes.</li>
    <li><code>strings</code> - Print the strings of printable characters in the file</li>
    <li><code>gzip, bzip2</code> – used to compress/expand files. Note the file type before doing anything.</li>
    <li><code>xxd </code>– Gives the memory hex dump.</li>
    <li><code>cp </code>– Copies a file from a source to the destination</li>
    <li><code>mv </code>– Moves a file from a source to a destination. Used especially for renaming files.</li>
    <li><code>nc </code>– Makes arbitrary TCP/UDP connections possible and listens. Has a plethora of functions/flags, utilities. Search for netcat.</li>
    <li><code>openssl</code> – OpenSSL Command Line Tool. Basically, s_client is really useful.</li>
    <li><code>s_client</code> – Used for connecting to a particular host especially through a particular port. Used with quite a few flags.</li>
    <li><code>nmap</code> – Used to know the status of all ports in the machine. Very useful for determining functions of the ports and to protect subsequent unprotected ports from  attacks.</li>
    <li>Setuids are binary executables. Search on Wikipedia for more information about their user access, etc. They can be executed by <code>./setuid_name {arguments_if_any}</code>. Also, {strings} can be used to find the working inside.</li>
    <li><code>cron, crontab</code> - pretty self explanatory. The time machine of the system.</li>

  <h3>Smash the stack</h3>
  <h4>Date: 22nd September, 2014</h4>
  <p>One of the main concepts involved in Capture The Flag stage, named Cusco, typically revolved around smashing the stack. The earlier stages involved finding clues about the password within the live memory. This one prevented any such processes, and allowed a longer password than the earlier one. Let us talk about what the term exactly means, so that we can effectively use it for future purposes.<br> What does it mean? <br>Smashing the stack, involves storing input into a stack, which will overflow the existing number of bytes in the stack. This thus, will creep into the memory locations of the neighboring registers, executing which, we can manipulate the program counter. Another hack procedure, could be to search for a return command, as the program counter will point to where the stack pointer is, after execution.

The <b>strcpy</b> function also has bugs, which can be exploited.

    <h3>Quine McClusky Implementation</h3>
    <h4>Date: 21st September, 2014</h4>
    <p>As part of my Digital Electronics Course, I implemented an implementation of the renowned Quine McClusky Algorithm for multivariable function minimization. So, here are the learnings that I could derive from it:
      <br>
    <b>Why Python</b>
      <br>
    I was personally biased towards Python for this particular problem statement, as I realised, that a number of arrays, and lists of different kinds of data would be required, for indexing and for storage purposes. Python offers a plethora of options, and also some built-in functions implementing which in C/Java could take various lines of code.

   <h3>Stack pointer and memory storage conventions</h3>
   <h4>Date: 20th September, 2014</h4> 
   <p>A noteworthy point of discussion is the difference in conventions of the stack pointer direction. Following are the points to note:
    <ul>
    <li>The stack pointer moves about, throughout the stack, and is the head of the stack. Any pushing/popping happens where it points to.</li>
    <li>Memory allocation is from bottom(least) to top(most).</li>
    <li>When the caller function meets the calling statement of another function, the stack pointer goes a few required bytes down, and begins execution of the statements. Then, it will come back and follow all steps again.</li>
    <li>The register values stored inside the functions also depend on the lexical scope that they’re based at. Hence, if any value needs to be stored, decrement/increment the sp accordingly and store the values there, to be popped at the time of reference.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Jumping into CTFs</h3>
    <h4>Date: 18th September, 2014</h4>
    <p>My first play and learn session with CTF was really exhilarating. This is a wonderful way to learn Assembly Language, and to gain a good understanding of what ‘Capture the Flag’ actually is. Following is a synopsis of the tutorial concerned with it, which forms the primary building block of what comes after this.<br>

     <b>Some Assembly commands were: </b> 
    <ul>
      <li><code>tst </code>– testing whether a number is non zero or not</li>
      <li><code>mov</code> – moving the first operand into the second operand [more appropriately, the value]</li>
      <li><code>add</code> – storing the sum of the two operands into the second one [will take only the 4 bits and ignore any overflow bits]</li>
      <li><code>inc/dec </code>– inc(dec)rementing the value of the register</li>
      <li><code>incd/decd</code> – inc(dec)rementing the value of the register by 2 bytes</li>
      <li><code>jnz</code> – jumping if the register dealt with in the previous line of code is not zero</li>
      <li><code>jeq/jz</code> – jumping if the register dealt with in the previous line of code is zero, or equal( essentially, both mean the same, as the cmp function hands over a ‘zero flag’ once the two numbers are equal.)</li>
      <li><code>cmp </code>– compares two values and stores the result in a status flag</li>
      <li><code>ret</code> – returns the control to the caller function
      <li><code>swpb</code> – swaps the bits [in a nibble]</li>
      <li><code>bis</code> - Binary subtracts and stores the lesser significant 4 bits/ Also called Bit set, or the ‘OR’ operation.</li>
      <li><code>sxt</code> – Extends the word to binary form, to enable mathematical operations on the register, like addition, multiplication, etc.    </li>
    </ul>  
    <br>
    <b>Some basic conventions are:</b>
      <ul>
        <li>#x – refers to a constant value to be added, operated or compare to.</li>
        <li>@R – works like the *ptr form, which accesses the value stored within a register pointed to by R. </li>
      </ul>
      <br>
      <b>Basic Learnings and things to carry forward
      </b>
      <ul>

      <li>sr – this is the Status Register, hovering the mouse over it would indicate  c-> carry flag is set, else it means that the zero flag is not set yet</li>
      <li>The Disassembly contains all the code available within the kernel for manipulation and reading</li>
      <li>The Memory Area will contain the values stored inside the different registers in their specific addresses</li>
      <li>The Instruction Area exactly contains which instruction is going to be executed. This can be accomplished properly with step(s), break(b) etc.</li>
      <li>The console can be reached for help by using the ‘help’ command</li>
      <li>In the tutorial, r12 – stores the number of letters the entered password contains</li>
      <li>All details are stored in hex, base 16</li>
      </ul>
      <br><b> Key Idea </b>
      Find the code line which needs to be reached, and try to backtrack your events from there for better understanding of what needs to be achieved. Analyse the <check-password> function properly.
