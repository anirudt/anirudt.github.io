<p>Interests are those streams of thought to which an individual may be attracted towards. It may reflect as to how the person’s brain functions, or perhaps what he/she intends to learn, or a measure of one’s mastery over a particular topic. For example, I am a person who thinks in a circuitous manner, so I might be the one to appreciate either very simple or overtly intricate plots. Thus, the interests of a person give us an insight into the thought process of the individual primarily.

<p>Academically, I like the general ideas of science and mathematics. I am preferentially interested in the areas of number theory and geometry in mathematics. Besides reading a few books on these topics, I also try learning and imparting knowledge in a few Facebook Math pages. I also like using and applying my knowledge into programming and coding in a few languages like C,C++,Java,MATLAB and web designing languages. I believe that programming is the new era of science and will attempt to simplify our visualizations in a better way. </p>

<p>As shared on my home page, I also appreciate various forms of music ranging from classical to western music. I like playing percussion instruments and it gives me an opportunity to blend with nature and its musical plethora. I also admire legends like M.S.Subhalakshmi and Pt. Ravi Shankar for their contributions in the field of music. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>  I am also interested in sports viz. cricket, tennis, football and table tennis. Having been exposed to a huge number of sports since childhood, I have been constantly in touch with sports happenings ever since. The dynamics of sports in life is universal and imperative to comprehend. Also, I take interest in the topics of human psychology and as to how the brain works. </p>
