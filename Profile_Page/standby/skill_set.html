<p> Skills of a person define the talent a person possesses. It is this talent with the help of which one performs his activities in his day to day life. So, it is quite necessary to have a basic skill set to implement his thoughts into productive work.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p> I feel that I have moderate to good grasping skills in most of the concepts that I begin to learn. It is very important to pick up the concepts in a rapid manner in this busy world. Also, the function of a coder is also quite appreciated in todayâ€™s time, especially in varied multi-functional languages. I also have been equipped with managerial roles during my tenure as a Team Leader in AIESEC.  The importance of team management and event management are also quite clear to me. I believe that I can work well under pressure conditions.I also have the capability to maintain my composure during such conditions.</p>
<p> Having been a member of the Google Students Club, IIT Kharagpur, I have been part of a a team which has conducted
 events on campus pertaining to the popularisation of the concept of Google and its products. Being incharge of its blog, which 
 can be reached <a href="http://www.gsciitkgp.blogspot.in">here</a>, I have gained good experience and exposure to the marketing
 and showcasing aspects of work.
