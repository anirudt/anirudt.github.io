                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p> Hello, I am an undergraduate student from IIT Kharagpur in the third year of Electrical Engineering 
enrolled in its Dual Degree Course. This is my home page and do feel free to browse the tabs for further details about me. 
Originally, I am from Mumbai, and have done majority of my schooling there.  </p>
<p> </p>

<p>    I hail from a middle class Tamilian background and have travelled around India to quite a few places, be it Puducherry,
 Bangalore, or Pune, or be it even stretching past the borders of India into Nepal.  Likewise, I like meeting people of different 
 backgrounds and exchanging cultures and ideas. Moreover, I like visiting places in the view of tourism and scenic beauty.  
 Music is also something which I appreciate.</p>
 
 <p> I also play the <em> tabla </em> , an Indian Hindustani classical instrument based on percussion and rhythm. I also like listening to classical music and western instrumentals. I especially prefer the works of Ilayaraja,  A.R. Rahman and Shankar Mahadevan when it comes to their contributions in this regard.

Apart from music, I also take interest in sports, with due bias towards cricket, tennis and table tennis. I admire Sachin Tendulkar and Rafael Nadal  in their respective sports. I enjoy playing table tennis during my leisure time. 
</p>

                    <h2>My Interests</h2>
                    <p>Interests are those streams of thought to which an individual may be attracted towards. It may reflect as to how the person’s brain functions, or perhaps what he/she intends to learn, or a measure of one’s mastery over a particular topic. For example, I am a person who thinks in a circuitous manner, so I might be the one to appreciate either very simple or overtly intricate plots. Thus, the interests of a person give us an insight into the thought process of the individual primarily.
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Academically, I like the general ideas of science and mathematics. I am preferentially interested in the areas of number theory and geometry in mathematics. Besides reading a few books on these topics, I also try learning and imparting knowledge in a few Facebook Math pages. I also like using and applying my knowledge into programming and coding in a few languages like C,C++,Java,MATLAB and web designing languages. I believe that programming is the new era of science and will attempt to simplify our visualizations in a better way. </p>

<p> </p>

<p>As shared on my home page, I also appreciate various forms of music ranging from classical to western music. I like playing percussion instruments and it gives me an opportunity to blend with nature and its musical plethora. I also admire legends like M.S.Subhalakshmi and Pt. Ravi Shankar for their contributions in the field of music. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>  I am also interested in sports viz. cricket, tennis, football and table tennis. Having been exposed to a huge number of sports since childhood, I have been constantly in touch with sports happenings ever since. The dynamics of sports in life is universal and imperative to comprehend. Also, I take interest in the topics of human psychology and as to how the brain works. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>In my field of Electrical Engineering, I am intrigued by the subjects of Digital Signal Processing and Microcontrollers. My previous winter was spent in learning coding in the Arduino Microcontroller in a project with Aditya Bhaskar and hence I'm more eager to learn about using robots for more useful utility purposes. </p>

				<h2>Skill Sets</h2>
				
<p> Skills of a person define the talent a person possesses. It is this talent with the help of which one performs his activities in his day to day life. So, it is quite necessary to have a basic skill set to implement his thoughts into productive work.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p> I feel that I have moderate to good grasping skills in most of the concepts that I begin to learn. It is very important to pick up the concepts in a rapid manner in this busy world. Also, the function of a coder is also quite appreciated in today’s time, especially in varied multi-functional languages. I also have been equipped with managerial roles during my tenure as a Team Leader in AIESEC.  The importance of team management and event management are also quite clear to me. I believe that I can work well under pressure conditions.I also have the capability to maintain my composure during such conditions.</p>
 <p> </p>
 <p>Having been a member of the Google Students Club, IIT Kharagpur, I have been part of a a team which has conducted events on campus pertaining to the popularisation of the concept of Google and its products. Being incharge of its blog, which can be reached <a href="http://www.gsciitkgp.blogspot.com">here</a>, I have gained good experience and exposure to the content development, and marketing and showcasing aspects of work.

I can be described as a person who likes to take up challenges and build them within a constraint of time. I like learning about different genres of subjects at the same time, giving me the ability to visualise their joint effectiveness and utility. Being a budding engineer, I guess that's what makes me happy ! </p>
